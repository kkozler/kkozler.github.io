    <p>Hi! I'm Keegan! .</p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer with 7+ years of experience building web applications and leading teams. I pride myself on delivering impactful results in both front-end and back-end domains, whether working with legacy systems or greenfield projects.</p>
    <p>In my time as a machine learning engineer at X by 2, I've worked with a great team to build Choreo-ED, a patient flow solution for emergency departments. During that time, I also completed a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in machine learning. Prior to that, I served as a technical lead at ProModel (later BigBear.ai) on their Shipyard AI product. (Check out my <a href="/assets/pdf/resume.pdf">resume</a> for more specifics!)</p>
    <p>I get excited when I'm able to work with great people to build cool things, and I love striving with my team toward the best possible version of ourselves as individuals and teammates.  </p>
    <p>In my life outside of work, I'm an avid musician and play piano and guitar. I also enjoy the challenge of strategy games and, in my free time, unwinding with books, movies, and quality time with my wife and two kids. </p>
